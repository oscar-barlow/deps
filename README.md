# deps
A repository with many long-lived branches, which defines the dependencies that live on my various machines. These take the form of:
* `Brewfile` and associated lockfile
* A `txt` file with apt dependencies in it, and a `Makefile` with convenience commands
* Same deal, but a snapfile, sigh

The machines currently supported by this repo are:
* A Macbook Pro, mostly for work (`mbp`)
* A personal laptop running Ubuntu (`ubuntu-laptop`)
* A Raspberry Pi (`raspberry-pi`)
